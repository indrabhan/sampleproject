Github:- It is actually a name of company which allow you to host your central repo on remote server where you store you data.

git:- It is a version control tool, using it you store your data into git hub.

git is distributed version control system.

Distributed :- here you have all the file on local machine also.so net connection is not required always.
		If central server crashes than also you will have backup on local machine.
		Eg:-git

Central:- here all you data is store on central, you dont have copy of it on local
	  so it require net connection all the time.
	  If central server crashes thanyou dont have backup on local machine.
	  Eg:- SVN (subversion)


why to use:-
	because it store data into central repo and on local machine also(local copy) i.e on user system.



1.)install git.(git is tool/software/package/library)
2.)create repo on github account.
3.)create folder in local-->In terminal go till the path of local folder and enter command
	"git init"
	you can see .git folder is created.
4.)now we want to make the remote folder as origin.
	so on same terminal where we were before enter below command
	**comand:- git remote add origin "<link of remote folder>"
	go to remote folder on github and click on dropwdown of "Clone or Downlaod" button and copy paste the http link.
 
5.)git pull origin master  


**********************************************************

first you have to add your files into index with the command "git add file path",this add the files into index.

"git status" with this command you can see which are the files are in index and are ready to commit.
means if you have made changes in file are have not added it, so this command will help you.
After adding the files it will help that which are the files remaining to commit.


git add file1, file2, file3 (will add only given file)
git commit -m "message for the given file added"

git add -A (will add all the files)
git commit -a -m "add message" (will commit all files)

git log (log of commented files)

***********************************branch************************
branch is mostly used when you are developing other functionality and now you dont want it to be included in main branch,you will merge it later.
sub branch will have all the files/folder of master branch and will also have files/folder created by itself.
 so you will create sub branch in remote server not on local machine.
In local machine you will create files and folder noramlly and will just commit that folder or file in subbranch. 


git branch subBranchName (in terminal you should be in main branch, It will create sub branch and it will contain all the code of main branch)

git checkout branchName (now you will be in that branch which you specified after checkout keyword)

git checkout master (here usig master keyword you will be in main branch)

git merge subBranchName (in terminal you should be in main branch)
	After merge if you made changes in sub file/folder and commit it in sub branch only, than the newly changes will not be available in 		main branch
